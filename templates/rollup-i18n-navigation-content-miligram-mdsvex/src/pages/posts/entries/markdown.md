# Markdown [md]

In 2002 Aaron Swartz created atx, "the true structured text format". Swartz and John Gruber then worked together to create the Markdown language in 2004,

Its key design goal is readability â€“ that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions,

Gruber wrote a Perl script, Markdown.pl, which converts marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML or HTML and replaces angle brackets  and ampersands '&' with their corresponding character entity references. It can take the role of a standalone script,  a plugin for Blosxom or a Movable Type, or of a text filter for BBEdit.
