# Stackmix [prerelease]
### Template generator based on Svelte and Routify.

---

Don't be fooled by the "prerelease". You should totally take it for a ride. 😎

## Getting started
```
npx stackmix [app-name]
cd [app-name]
npm install
npm run dev
```

Remember to report any bugs back to us. 😉

---

## Getting started [for contributors and testers]
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/roxiness/stackmix.git
$ cd routify-templates
$ npm install
```

#### To build a template from fragments
`npm run generate`

__The wizard can be skipped by providing fragments as arguments__
`npm run generate -- -fragments rollup,i18n,navigation,content,miligram,mdsvex`

__use `--watch` to update output on fragment change__

---

**Given the variety of fragments, we would greatly appreciate contributors for this projects** 🙏
