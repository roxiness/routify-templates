# Routify Templates [alpha]
Welcome to the Routify Templates repo! This project is still in development and should be considered experimental.

If you're okay with the experimental status, please take it for a whirl and report any issues you may encounter.


## Getting started [for contributors and testers]
```bash

#### To build a template from fragments
`npm run generate`

__The wizard can be skipped by providing fragments as arguments__
`npm run generate -- -fragments rollup,i18n,navigation,content,miligram,mdsvex`
