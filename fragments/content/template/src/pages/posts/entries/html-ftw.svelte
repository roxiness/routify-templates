<h1>HTML FTW</h1>
<p>
  There are two axes differentiating various variations of HTML as currently specified: SGML-based HTML versus XML-based
  HTML (referred to as XHTML) on one axis, and strict versus transitional (loose) versus frameset on the other axis.

<p>
  To understand the subtle differences between HTML and XHTML, consider the transformation of a valid and well-formed
  XHTML 1.0 document that adheres to Appendix C (see below) into a valid HTML 4.01 document. To make this translation
  requires the following steps:
</p>

<p>
  Those are the main changes necessary to translate a document from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01. To translate from HTML to
  XHTML would also require the addition of any omitted opening or closing tags. Whether coding in HTML or XHTML it may
  just be best to always include the optional tags within an HTML document rather than remembering which tags can be
  omitted.
